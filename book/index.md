# Practical TinyMLOps: How to build an MLOps System for TinyML

TinyML is the process of deploying models on microcontrollers and other resource constrained devices. Preparing models for TinyML requires extra steps which a standard MLOps pipeline does not have. Many existing steps need to augmented with TinyML specific implementations or even removed. This is why we need TinyMLOps

In this book we talk about what TinyMLOps is, the different challenges that a TinyML Engineer can face when building such a pipeline and the tools you can use to build one. Finally we show you how to build a TinyMLOps  system for your project.


**Note**: This book is currently a work in progress. You can start by reading about how to build a TinyMLOps pipeline for training models [here](chapters/train/what_is_training)
